# dataanalysis

This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. 

The motivation behind the analysis was to understand how the Olympics have evolved over time, identify specific trends, and investigate the participation of different countries, genders, etc. I was also particularly interested in exploring the concept of the home field advantage to try to understand if we see statistically significant backing for this concept.
